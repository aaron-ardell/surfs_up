# Surfs Up
## Overview

Analyzing the weather data for the Oahu area for the client, they've requested temperature data specifically for the months of June and December. They are looking to determine if their surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round. 

We'll utilize the sqlite database provided with the data from 9 weather stations in the Oahu area. After inserting our dependencies, our first order of business will be generating a query that will pull the temperature data by month. Then we'll generate a DataFrame from the list we'd created. Finally, we'll repeat the process for the other month so we have two databases for June and December independently.  

## Results





3 key differences between dec and june  data


## Summary

2 additional queries to gather more data for june and dec
